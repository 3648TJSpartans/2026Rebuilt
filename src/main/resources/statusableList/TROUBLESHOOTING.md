# Troubleshooting with LEDS
Follow this guide to troubleshoot issues with subsystems using the LEDs.

## Reading Statuses
To read the status for a particular subsystem, count from the **RoboRIO end of the LED strip** to the LED that corresponds to your subsystem. See the subsystem names below for indices.

### Colors
| Color | Meaning | Description                                                               |
| ----- | ------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 🟩     | Good    | Subsystem fully operational.                                              |
| 🟨     | Warning | There is a minor issue with the subsystem that may impede its operation.  |
| 🟥     | Error   | There is a major issue with the subsystem that will impede its operation. |
| 🟪     | Unknown | Status reporting is yet to be implemented for the subsystem.              |

## Deciphering issues
The following is a list of what might be causing warning and errors for each subsystem. Check each problem that corresponds with the color to figure out what exactly is wrong.
